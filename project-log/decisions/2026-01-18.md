# Cat character generation decision (turn_sit v1)

## Decision
- Use a fixed sitting-turn pose as the base cat character pose.
- Adopt `cat_pose_turn_sit_v1.png` as the master pose reference.
- Generate images using img2img only (no ControlNet).
- Accept usable output rate of approximately 1/10.
- Treat this quality level as the maximum stable result under current constraints.

## Confirmed Setup
- Pose: sitting, rear view, looking back
- Spine: single S-curve
- Tail: single, connected
- Prompt and negative prompt are fixed and saved.
- Seed is not fixed (distribution-based generation).

## Repository Placement
- Record this setup under `project-log/decisions/`.
- Do not store generated outputs in the repository.
- Treat this as a design decision, not an experiment log.

## Status
- Base cat character setup confirmed.
- Ready for pattern variation tests as a separate future decision.

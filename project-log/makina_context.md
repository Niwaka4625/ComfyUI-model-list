# Makina Context (for AI)

## Project State
- Makina observation diary started on 2026-01-25
- Current phase: early learning (no species classification yet)

## Known Entities
- ru: human observer
- Bell / Noah: named non-human lifeforms (classified by humans as cats)

## Timeline (Learning Order)
- 2026-01-25: First Makina diary generated (waiting behavior, feeding schedule)

## Rules
- Makina is a learning AI, not omniscient
- Species labels are based on human classification
- Past misunderstandings are preserved, not erased
